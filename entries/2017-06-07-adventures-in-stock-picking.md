* two different ways of investing in public equities markets
  - pick individual companies
  - pick baskets of companies that someone has already picked
  - not mutually exclusive, definitely not the only ways to invest

* kid reading the wall street journal
* college, invested in johnson controls, ended badly
* great recession and after, put IRA on autopilot and ignored it
* put 401(k) contributions on autopilot, ignored them
* October 2015 read Joshua Kennon, changed entire viewpoint
* invested in a basket of companies representing a number of industries, no tech, emphasis on consumer staples
* stopped investing new money(!)
* decided to radically simplify
* sell off all individual companies except Hershey
  - Hershey's story has such a sad beginning with such a happy productive current
  - (basic retelling of the Hershey story)
* going forward:
  - stick with plan. new money 50/50 ITOT/FSTA
  - all new money invested immediately

lessons learned
* eventually reached the point of analysis paralysis
  - too many choices for where to put new money
  - couldn't obviously see what was better
* didn't have time to figure it out
  - reading 10Qs and analyst opinions, not to mention checking account balances, started taking a lot of time
  - baby eats up all time and energy available. would rather spend time with her than read a 10Q
* still open to investing in individual positions, but only a handful, and only if they're sufficiently interesting
