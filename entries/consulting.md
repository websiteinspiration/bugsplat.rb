Are you looking to **jumpstart a new project** or clean up an old codebase? Have a **thorny devops problem** you need some help with? I have a vast array of skills and experience to **help your business succeed**, on time and on budget. These are some of my recently completed projects:

* Paired with a customer and walked through **Docker** and how it could apply to their projects
* Built methods for installing a traditional PHP application onto Platform-as-a-Service providers like **Heroku** and **CloudFoundry**
* Set up an extensive test suite for a customer's **Rails/Stripe integration**

I specialize in:

* Payment systems including Stripe, Balanced, and Braintree
* Infrastructure and DevOps, including AWS, Heroku, Email, and DNS
* Ruby and Rails

<blockquote>Pete's help was instrumental in getting Docverter up and running to auto-generate PDF gift certificates.  We were able to smoothly sell and instantly deliver via email over $100,000 in GCs during our holiday season.
