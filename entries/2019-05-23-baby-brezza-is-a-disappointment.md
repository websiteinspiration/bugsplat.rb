title: Baby Brezza is a Disappointment

**__tl:dr: don't buy it. There's a better alternative.__**

When my wife and I decided to have another kid I knew immediately what my first purchase would be.
Not a crib. Not a blanket. Not a onesie. Not even a SNOO (we did end up getting one, comprehensive review forthcoming).

No, my first purchase was going to be a Baby Brezza.
The Baby Brezza is a machine that acts kind of like a coffee or espresso machine for baby formula.
You put water in one chamber and formula in another.
When you're ready to make some formula you just put a bottle under the spout and punch a big friendly button.
The machine takes care of keeping the water at the right temperature and dispensing the correct amount of formula with no mess.

I talked this thing up to everyone I saw.
I thought it was the bees knees. No thought required! Sleep deprivation adaptation!
When the box arrived I set it up on the counter and basked in it's majesty.

When the baby finally came home after a lengthy NICU stay I started using the machine immediately.

## Disillusionment

The Baby Brezza never really lived up to it's potential.

It's fast, alright. Like 30 seconds from empty to ready to feed with just one button press. That's basically the only good thing.

The big selling point, other than it being fast, is that it supposedly reduces the amount of bubbles in the formula when compared to just shaking up a bottle, thus reducing gas and ultimately reducing the amount of crying the baby does.
That's a powerful thing!

Except it doesn't. Not really. Maybe a little? I dunno.

## Cleaning

The other thing they don't really tell you in the sales material is that you have to clean the thing.
A lot.
You have to run through a short cleaning routine every single day and a more in-depth routine every week
If you skip cleaning you risk the thing growing gross mold all over.

Think: I'm already a horribly sleep deprived, semi-delusional parent who is cutting every single corner possible.
Why would I voluntarily sign up to clean yet another thing?

## Alternative

Thankfully there's a simple, cheap alternative.

[picture of mixing jug]

Get a $20 mixing jug and a bottle warmer.
Formula keeps for 24 hours in the fridge, so just mix up a batch once a day.
That way you can just pour and warm what you need when you need it.
It's a tiny bit slower than the Brezza but sitting in the fridge actually does reduce the amount of bubbles.
It doesn't add a significant amount of time because you just wash it at the same time you're washing bottles.
