### Experience

#### Software Developer, 2012 - Current ####

[Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com), Portland OR

* Maintain and optimize one of the largest and oldest Ruby on Rails applications in existence. Kongregate receives over 10 million visits per month across more than 60,000 free-to-play single- and multiplayer games.

* Work across the entire stack, from MySQL query optimization to Ruby and Node.js background jobs to front-end HTML, Javascript and CSS.

* Implemented a lapsed-gamer mailer with customized messages for every user which increased retention by ~5%.

* Daily work on tasks using Pivotal Tracker, GitHub, and the Jenkins continuous integration server.

#### Platform Developer, 2011 - 2012 ###

[Emma](http://www.myemma.com), Portland OR

* Ported the audience management system of Emma, including mailing list management, audience searches, administration, and sending mail into a REST service in Python, PostgreSQL and Redis.

* Built a search engine that consumes a JSON search description, builds an equivalent SQL query, and executes the query on a sharded PostgreSQL database system. This is used for filtering all requests that come into the audience REST service.

* Worked with and extended a large Django application that forms the front-end of Emma's email marketing service.


#### Software Developer, 2007 - 2011 ###

[Rentrak](http://www.rentrak.com), Portland OR

* Designed, developed, and deployed two different demographics systems for linear television that have set the direction of all future demographics systems at Rentrak. These systems overlay postal- and household-level segmentation on top of hundreds of billions of television view transactions.

* Developed a SQL-like language that compiles to C++ using Perl and [Parse::RecDescent](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-RecDescent) to enable internal users to query the view repository.

* Designed a new product from scratch with another developer focusing on the backend data processing. Built a DSL-like system within Perl for succinct summary table definition which allows developers to create new summary tables quickly and with very low maintenance overhead.
  
* Wrote one-time and repeatable data extraction and analysis programs for the CIO and the research department to better understand hundreds of billions of television view transactions.
