## The Setup

* One Fidelity Brokerage Account ("brokerage")
* One Fidelity Cash Management Account ("CMA")

## How Money Flows

* Payroll direct deposited into brokerage
* Bills autopay from brokerage (credit cards, insurance, billpay to household vendors)
* Debit cards and live paper checks written against CMA

## Why

We use a brokerage account because it lets us keep cash and investments in the same account.
All of our cash, including working capital and reserves, sits in the brokerage's **core position**.
Our core position is FZFXX, a Federal money market fund that pays ~2% interest.

We have the CMA so we don't expose the brokerage account number every time we write a paper check.
This is probably overly paranoid and is the only significant complication in the entire system.

The CMA can optionally have "self-funded overdraft protection" turned on, which would automatically transfer from the brokerage account into the CMA to fund checks and debit card transactions.
We don't have this turned on, again mostly for paranoia.
We make so few transactions like this that it's no problem to top up the account every few months.

The brokerage core position is not FDIC insured.
**I don't care about FDIC insurance**.
FZFXX is composed of ultra short term US Treasury bills. 
If Treasuries are suddenly not liquid enough to withdraw our money our society has much bigger problems.

The CMA's core position *is* FDIC insured, and the CMA is almost a full brokerage account, but we don't use it as the centerpiece account for two reasons.
First, the CMA core position pays shit for interest.
Second, the CMA cannot have margin turned on.
We'll talk about why that's important in the next post.
