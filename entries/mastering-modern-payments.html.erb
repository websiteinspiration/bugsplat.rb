<p>
  Every time you have to write another Stripe integration you drag your heels. It's frustrating. There are <strong>lots of moving pieces</strong> and no one place to see a complete implementation. How do you work with <strong>webhooks</strong>? Where should you <strong>set up subscription plans</strong>? What's the best way to make sure <strong>your customers aren't left hanging</strong> if Stripe falls over?
</p>

<p>
  Tutorials only get you so far, though. Soon, you're looking at blog posts from years ago and wondering if they're still correct. <strong>API documentation doesn't help if you don't know what you're looking for</strong>. GitHub has lots of payment gems, but how do you know if they're any good?
</p>

<p>
What if you could read a story and follow along with a complete production application? What if you knew for certain that you're reading the most up-to-date best practices?
</p>

<h2>What if you could get paid sooner and more reliably?</h2>

<p>
Over the last two years I've written Stripe integrations for a dozen Rails applications. Like you, I've combed through the docs and the blog posts and the GitHub repositories looking for answers and come up short.

    Mastering Modern Payments was like a pool of <strong>cool refreshing water</strong> after I'd been traveling in the desert of obscurity for weeks. Unlike the API docs, or most blog posts I found on the topic, Pete thought this through three steps ahead of solving the problems I'd be having a few weeks or months after deployment. This will end up <strong>saving me an immeasurable amount of time and money</strong>.

Pete's book is a guiding light of common sense and practical application. Now I can setup billing with confidence, and more importantly, <strong>ship my product</strong>.

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em">Which package should I buy?</h2>

<p>That depends on your budget. I strongly suggest the Complete Package because the code is very helpful for understanding the book. That said, the Basic Package has a ton of value all by itself.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Can I upgrade later on?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! Just reply to your confirmation email that you'd like to upgrade and I'll set it up for you.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Will I get updates?</h2>

<p>Stripe and Rails both move fast. As they do, I send out periodic updates to the book and the sample application.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Can I pay with PayPal?</h2>

<p>No problem. Just send the amount that corresponds to the version you want to <code>paypal@petekeen.net</code>.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 2em">What if I get nothing out of this?</h2>

<p>The current version of the guide is the product of over a year of editing and conversations with dozens of developers just like you. If you're a Rails developer integrating Stripe, this is the guide for you. That said, if you feel like you haven't gotten your money's worth, simply send me an email for a <strong>full 100% money back guarantee.</strong></p>
