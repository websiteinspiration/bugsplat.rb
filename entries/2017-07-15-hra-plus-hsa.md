Our family elected to sign up for an HSA-compatible high deductible health insurance plan for 2017.
It ended up being lower cost than any other plan we could find assuming we used our entire out of pocket max.
Well, it's March 2nd and we've used our entire out of pocket max, all $9,000 of it.

Last week I came across the idea of using what's called a Section 105 Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) to reimburse out of pocket expenses, including deductibles and copays.
HRAs have been around since the 1970's as a way for companies to reimburse medical expenses for their employees.
The Affordable Care Act changed a bunch of things, though, and one of those things was how a section 105 plan gets treated.
For employers with two or more employees HRAs were suddenly major medical plans that didn't actually cover the ten essential health
benefits and came with a fine of $100/day/employee.
They naturally fell out of favor.

Businesses like the one I run with my wife are excluded from that requirement by dint of only employing one person (there's a technicality that allows two employees to count as one if they're spouses).

## What does an HRA get you?

The types of HRA we're talking about is a health plan that allows your company to reimburse you, the business owner, for medical expenses that you incur, other than premiums for a major medical policy.
