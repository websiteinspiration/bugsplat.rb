<h1 class="book big center">You booked a client! Hurray!</h1>

<h2 class="book big center">Now what?</h2>

You thought this consulting thing would be great. Just quit your soul-sucking full time job, say goodbye to your micromanaging boss, and run your own business.

You're going to do everything your way. ***The right way.*** Because that's what a business does, right?

Right?

Except... *what do you do now?*

People want to pay you.

You probably need to pay taxes.

What about retirement? Can you even retire?

Oh, and you probably want to put food on the table too.

My name is <a href="/">Pete Keen</a> and I'm working on a little cookbook that will give you, my newly-forged consultant friend, a smattering of recipes designed to help **move your business forward** and, more importantly, **save you time** so you can **help more clients**.

Here's a taste of the table of contents (subject to change):

* Organizing
  - Make an LLC, it's as easy as 1-2-there is no 3!
  - Elect S-Corp, and here's why
  - Save for taxes! Pay them quarterly!
* Contracts
  - Why use a written contract?
  - Here's the best starting point.
  - It's dangerous to go alone! Get a contract attorney.
* Invoicing
  - When to invoice.
  - How to invoice.
  - Daily / weekly / monthly is *so* much easier than hourly.
* Getting Paid
  - People will send you paper checks even if you hate paper checks.
  - Some people will want to ACH/Wire
  - Should you offer credit card payments? Other options? Bitcoin?
* Bookkeeping
  - Keep your own books.
  - It doesn't have to be hard! You have fewer transactions than you think.
  - Use ledger! Or not, it's your business.
* Paying Yourself
  - Why you should pay yourself a salary.
  - Use a payroll company to do it. Here's the one to use.
  - What's a "reasonable salary"?
* Banking
  - You definitely need a bank that isn't your personal bank.
  - Business banking isn't free (except it is!).
  - What about rainy day savings?
* Retiring
  - You probably don't want to do this forever.
  - Options for just you.
  - Options if you have employees.
