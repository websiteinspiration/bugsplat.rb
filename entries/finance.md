Over the past few years I've written a number of posts about [Ledger](http://www.ledger-cli.org), a command-line accounting system. In a nutshell, when using Ledger you keep your financial records in a plain text file and then run reports using the `ledger` command line program.

All about my financial journey, from debt-ridden towards debt-free. More importantly, this is a very basic introduction to how to use ledger to keep track of your finances. This has been described as the best introduction to ledger out there.

#### [Program your Finances: Reporting for Fun and Profit](/program-your-finances-reporting-for-fun-and-profit)

Outlines a reporting system that I used for awhile to run queries against my ledger data that I couldn't with the native ledger program. Also introduces a small tool for generating realistic sample ledger data.

Describes a system that I hacked together in an afternoon before a recent vacation that let me keep track of vacation finances on the fly without a laptop.

#### [Program your Finances: Automated Transactions](/program-your-finances-automated-transactions)
Gives a simple introduction to ledger's automated transactions and virtual accounts, two features that are great by themselves but let you do really interesting things when combined.
