[VMSave](https://vmsave.petekeen.net) has made over 10,000 total calls as of yesterday.
That's an astounding number to me.
Originally VMSave was a tiny ruby script that I made to save my wife's mom's outgoing voicemail message. With her encouragement I made it into a full-fledged service. I never thought it woudl get this big, and yet here we are.

Here's some stats:

* 8,690 completed recordings
* 5,363 emails sent
* 41,432 minutes of call time
* $3,616 in donations to keep the service running
* Dozens of emails and hand written letters

I built VMSave to help people process their grief. Based on the feedback I’ve received and the numbers above, I think it’s worked.
