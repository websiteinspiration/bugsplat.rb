Today in my calendar there's a little entry that just says "1000 days."

One thousand days ago I received my first infusion of life saving deadly poison.

Between that day and today, I received twenty infusions of poison and then the best news: I was cancer free.

I also lost a parent. Wrote a book. Got married to a beautiful, amazing, tolerant, hilarious woman.

I lost another parent. Moved across the country. Bought a house.

I got married again, to that same beautiful, amazing, tolerant, hilarious woman. We honeymooned in Niagara Falls.

I quit my job. Made myself another one. Lost a pet. Wrote another book.

What's the common thread?

I'm still here.

And that's something to celebrate.
