description: I am now an independent consultant!
---

At the ripe old age of 12 I started messing around with computers. I've been hooked ever since. I've also read everything I could get my hands on about business, hoping to some day be able to start my own. However, I took the well-worn path of college, then into industry where I lucked into a series of great jobs.

Today, I'm finally striking out on my own. Today I'm throwing open the doors to my software development consultancy.

I want to thank my former employer Kongregate for putting up with me over the past few years. It's been a hard road for all of us, and they've been amazing. It's definitely not them. (By the way, if you're an amazing Rails developer [they're hiring!](http://www.kongregate.com/pages/jobs)).

Enough about me. How about you? Do you have a project you need help with? I bring almost ten years of professional software development experience to the table, with a focus in online payment systems and high performance, high traffic web application development. <strong>[Let's talk](https://okapi.io)</strong>.
