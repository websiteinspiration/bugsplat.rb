<h1 class="book big center">You booked a client! Hurray!</h1>

<h2 class="book big center">Now what?</h2>

You thought this self-employed thing would be great. Just quit your soul-sucking full time job, say goodbye to your micromanaging boss, and run your own business.

You're going to do everything your way. ***The right way.*** Because that's what a business does, right?

Right?

Except... *what do you do now?*

Your clients want to pay you.

You probably need to pay taxes.

What about retirement? Can you even retire?

Oh, and you probably want to put food on the table too.

**You'll learn how to set up your business infrastructure for success**, even if you're not starting from scratch.

**There are lots of sharp edges when you're running a business**, and they'll cut you if you don't know about them. In Handle Your Business **you'll learn where those traps are and how to avoid them.**
