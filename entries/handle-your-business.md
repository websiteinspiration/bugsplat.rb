<h1 class="book big center">You booked a client! Hurray!</h1>

<h2 class="book big center">Now what?</h2>

You thought this self-employed thing would be great. Just quit your soul-sucking full time job, say goodbye to your micromanaging boss, and run your own business.

You're going to do everything your way. ***The right way.*** Because that's what a business does, right?

Except... *what do you do now?*

<hr>

Your clients want to pay you.

You need to pay taxes.

What about retirement? Is retirement even in the cards??

Oh, and you probably want to put food on the table too.

## Learn What You Don't Know about Running a Business

Running a business can get you in trouble quick if you're not paying attention. In Handle Your Business **you'll learn where those traps are and how to avoid them.**

Could you find out all of this on your own? Sure, that's what I did. After spending weeks of time reading thousands of blog posts and hundreds of pages of IRS documents, I learned what I needed to know. *You don't need to go through all that pain*.

**Handle Your Business** will teach you the things you don't know you don't know about running a consulting business, so you can ask your trusted advisors the right questions without wasting their time and your money.

## Each chapter is packed with knowledge

**Organizing** gets you off on the right foot, explaining the different types of business entities you can choose, along with their tax implications.

**Banking** will teach you why you need a separate bank account, what your options are, and guides you into the best choice for you.

**Contracts** shows you what a contract looks like and how to structure yours to save the most money and time.

**Invoicing** is all about invoices: what to include and when to send them.

**Bookkeeping** walks you through a simple do-it-yourself bookkeeping example and then gives recommendations for services that do it for you.

**Insurance** shows you how to protect yourself from lawsuits by buying the right coverage.

**Getting Paid** gives a selection of options for how your clients can pay you, the ones you should allow, and the ones you shouldn't.

**Tax Planning and Retiring** goes through an overview of tax planning topics, including how to save money on your taxes by saving for your retirement.
