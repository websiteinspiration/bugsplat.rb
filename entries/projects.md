<h4 id="fivepad"><a href="http://www.fivepad.me">Fivepad</a></h4>

The easiest way to keep track of your apartment search. I build this to help my girlfriend and I search for apartments in the Portland area, but it's useful anywhere Craigslist has coverage. Using it is pretty simple. You just paste in a Craigslist URL into the Add a Place box and it scrapes the page for useful information and shows it to you on a map, along with all of your other places. Fivepad is a straightforward Rails application which is now shut down.
