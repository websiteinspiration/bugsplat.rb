Let's say you do some consulting work once in awhile.
You do some work, people pay you, everyone's happy.

Now, let's say you want to make a living with consulting, [like I did a year ago](/lets-begin-again).
What do you need to know?
How do you set up an effective, legitimate business around your work?

I did over two years of research into how to set up my business properly, both to protect me and to save money on taxes every year.
There's an awful lot you need to know, and a whole lot of noise you don't.

My new book **[Handle Your Business](/handle-your-business)** gives you all of the good stuff and none of the noise in a succinct, easy to read guide.

Learn everything you need:

* What business entity to pick
* How to structure your contracts
* Where to get a business bank account
* The insurance coverage you need, and what you don't
* ...and more!

**Handle Your Business** is available today. To get a sample chapter, just fill out the form below.
